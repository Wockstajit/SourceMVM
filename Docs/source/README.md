# SOURCE:MVM for Source 1 games

The Source 1 port of the filmmaker lives in the inherited Source 1 hook, `AfxHookSource.dll`, which
is injected into the game. The first target is Counter-Strike: Source, the 64-bit Steam build
(`cstrike_win64.exe`). Everything the port adds is under `AfxHookSource/Filmmaker/`. The inherited
HLAE files only call into it at marked `// SOURCE:MVM` lines.

## Build

The x64 Source 1 hook is built by the legacy `x64-release` preset. Build only the hook target, then
stage it with its runtime and resources into `build/source1-release`:

```batch
cmake --preset x64-release
```

```batch
cmake --build build/x64-release --config Release --target AfxHookSource --parallel
```

```batch
cmake --install build/x64-release --config Release --prefix build/source1-release --component x64-runtime
```

```batch
cmake --install build/x64-release --config Release --prefix build/source1-release --component x64-source1
```

The stage holds `bin/x64/AfxHookSource.dll` with its runtime DLLs, and `bin/resources/` with the
shaders and the hex font the hook loads at runtime. The injector and the launch host come from the
CS2 stage (`build.bat -NoLaunch` once) and from `SourceMovieMakerLauncher\scripts\build-host.ps1`.
Both are game-agnostic.

## Launch

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Automation\launch\launch-css.ps1
```

Run it as a background task and read the exit code. It starts CS:S offline (`-insecure`), windowed
at 854x480 with D3D9, moves the window to Windows DISPLAY3, and waits until the hook answers
`mirv_filmmaker health` on its command port. A hook startup error appears as a message box titled
"Error - AfxHookSource", which the script reports. `-condebug` mirrors the console into
`cstrike\console.log`.

Close the game with the console `quit` command. Never kill the process.

## Command port

The CS:S 64-bit engine has no `-netconport`, so the hook serves the same protocol itself
(`Shared/NetconServer`) when the game is started with `-mvmnetconport <port>`. Port 29030 is the
default, beside CS2's 29010 and Deadlock's 29020. Nothing listens without the flag.

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Automation\netcon\css-netcon.ps1 -CommandBatch "mirv_filmmaker health"
```

Console output reaches the client through tier0's spew function, which the hook chains in front of
the engine's. Commands run on the main thread: the listener posts a window message, and the hook's
window procedure queues each command into the engine's command buffer, as if it had been typed.

## Test demo

Runtime checks use a self-recorded demo, because no CS:S demo ships with the repository. Record one
with bots over the command port. Wait for `in-game=1` in `health` between the second and third
lines, and about 40 seconds before `stop`:

```text
sv_lan 1;;maxplayers 12;;map de_dust2
bot_quota 10;;mp_freezetime 1;;mp_roundtime 3;;spectate;;mp_restartgame 1
record mvm_css_test
stop;;disconnect
```

The demo lands in `cstrike\mvm_css_test.dem` and plays with `playdemo mvm_css_test`.

## Console commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mirv_filmmaker health` | Hook build, game, engine interfaces, command port counters, pump counts, and connection, map and demo state |

`health` is the first check when something stops working. `console capture REPLACED` means the
engine installed its own spew function after ours, so command output no longer reaches the port.
A `frame render starts` count that stays at 0 means the client frame hook is not running.
